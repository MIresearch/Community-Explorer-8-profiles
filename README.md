<H2><b> The Community Explorer</b> </H2> <Hr>

The <b>Community Explorer</b> investigate US health disparities by first understanding populations' specificities then looking at their health
profile. It identifies the different populations or communities based on their behavioral, demographic, economic, and social profiles. Then it links these profiles to chronic disease prevalence rates. 

The eight community profiles were identified by using Explanatory Factor Analysis and machine learning techniques, to sort 26 behavioral, demographic, economic, and social factors across 3,192 US counties. 

The map below shows the location of these <b>8 community profiles</B>: 
<br><b>1</b> - the most ethnically diverse community with the highest income level. It is a highly educated cohort that resides in large metro areas. (38% US population)
<br><b>2</b> - highly educated, economically prosperous, mostly White counties in metro areas. (25% US population)
<br><b>3</b> - the largest Black population, whose income is the lowest income of all the profiles. These counties are primarily concentrated in the south-east. (12% US population)
<br><b>4</b> - the largest white population with the lowest income of all the profiles. It encompasses mostly rural counties in the East North Central, and Northeast regions. (7% US population)
<br><b>5</b> - predominantly White counties whose economy depends mostly on manufacturing and are located around the Midwest region. (6% US population) 
<br><b>6</b> - the youngest cohort of the profiles, with the largest Hispanic population, the least education level, access to healthy food, and health insurance. The counties are concentrated in the West and West South-Central regions.  (5% US population)
<br><b>7</b> - the oldest cohort of the profiles and consists of mostly White, elderly retirement communities. (4% US population)
<br><b>8</b> - the most rural cohort made of an older White population with the most limited access to healthy food of all the profiles. The counties are mostly in the north part of the West, Midwest, and Northeast regions. (3% US population)<br>
