The <b>Community Explorer</b> allows to investigate US health disparities differently by first identifying populations' specificities (behavioral, demographic, economic, and social profiles) then linking them to their health profile. 

It sorts 26 behavioral, demographic, economic, and social factors across 3,192 US counties into eight community profiles. Identifying these community profiles and the interaction among factors within each one relies on Explanatory Factor Analysis and machine learning techniques.

The map below shows the location of the <b>8 community profiles</B>: 
<br><b>1</b> - the most ethnically diverse community with the highest income level. It is a highly educated cohort that resides in large metro areas. (38% US population)
<br><b>2</b> - highly educated, economically prosperous, mostly White counties in metro areas. (25% US population)
<br><b>3</b> - the largest Black population, whose income is the lowest income of all the profiles. These counties are primarily concentrated in the south-east. (12% US population)
<br><b>4</b> - the largest white population with the lowest income of all the profiles. It encompasses mostly rural counties in the East North Central, and Northeast regions. (7% US population))
<br><b>5</b> - predominantly White counties whose economy depends mostly on manufacturing and are located around the Midwest region. (6% US population) 
<br><b>6</b> - the youngest cohort of the profiles, with the largest Hispanic population, the least education level, access to healthy food, and health insurance. The counties are concentrated in the West and West South-Central regions.  (5% US population)
<br><b>7</b> - the oldest cohort of the profiles and consists of mostly White, elderly retirement communities. (4% US population)
<br><b>8</b> - the most rural cohort made of an older White population with the most limited access to healthy food of all the profiles. The counties are mostly in the north part of the West, Midwest, and Northeast regions. (3% US population)<br>
